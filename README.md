# Railway-or-Bus-Ticket-Booking-System

The Railway/Bus Reservation System enables users to make inquiries about the trains that are available based on source and destination, make reservations and cancellations, check the status of their reservations, and more. The project's goal is to design and create a database that will keep track of various trains and buses, as well as their train and bus statuses and passenger details. It is a computerised method for making in advance reservations for seats on trains and buses. It is mostly used on long trips. More than ever, making a seat reservation online is now a simple process. Given that it prevents public gatherings, this project is helpful in emergency scenarios like pandemics.
